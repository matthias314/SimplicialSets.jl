    $(@__MODULE__)

This package provides types and functions to work with simplicial sets.
Various kinds of simplicial sets are supported, including symbolic simplices,
products, bar constructions and Kan loop groups.
The Eilenbergâ€“Zilber maps and interval cut operations are also implemented.

The package uses `LinearCombinations.jl` to represent formal linear combinations
of simplices and other objects. By default, coefficients are of type `Int`.
